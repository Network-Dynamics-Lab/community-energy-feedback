## community-energy-feedback
This repository documents the source code for a mobile application visualizing building energy data across communities and cities. The application was developed as a part of research efforts in the [Network Dynamics Lab](http://ndl.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, and is associated with the following publications: 

- Francisco, A., & Taylor, J. E. (2019). Understanding citizen perspectives on open urban energy data through the development and testing of a community energy feedback system. Applied Energy, 256.

## Functionalities
The application consists of three major functionalities:

- Spatial: as users walk through community, augmented reality icons pop-up and display building energy intensity.
