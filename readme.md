## open-urban-energy-data-feedback-system
This repository documents the source code for a mobile application visualizing building energy data across communities and cities. The application was developed as a result of research efforts in the [Network Dynamics Lab](http://ndl.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, and is associated with the following publications: [Designing community-scale energy feedback](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610219308525).

The application consists of three major functionalities:

- Spatial: as users walk through community, augmented reality icons pop-up and display building energy intensity.
